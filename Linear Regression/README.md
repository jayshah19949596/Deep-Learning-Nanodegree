## Linear regression Model
* This is a Linear Regression Model to predicting Life expectancy (X variable) based on BMI (Y Variable)
* The csv file comes comes from [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/)
* I have used sklearn package to build the regression model 
* It is a simple regression model with x and y being the variables

## Linear Regression Explaination

In statistics, linear regression is an approach for modeling the relationship between a scalar dependent variable y and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables) denoted X. The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression 
which is in our case. 

In Linear Regression we always find the best fit line i.e. line that best fit the given data.
So we want to find equation of a line : 
<b>y = mx + b </b> such that it best fit the data and does the right prediction for new data coming in. 
In  above equation m is slop of data and b is the y intercept.
