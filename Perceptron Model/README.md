# Perceptron Model
 * This is a simple Neural Network from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day. 
 * Activation function used is a sigmoidal function.
 * The dataset used is a real dataset from UCI repository.   
 * Link to [UCI dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset)
 * This project is a part of Deep Learning Nano-Degree
